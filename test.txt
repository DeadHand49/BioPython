a Successful Unrelated Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation with Reduced Intensity-Conditioning Regimen in a Patient with Late-Onset Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency
>>-->>Publication Content>>
PNP deficiency is a rare combined immunodeficiency with autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The immunodeficiency is progressive with normal immune functions at birth, but then, T-cell deficiency with variable B-cell functions usually presents by the age of two yr. The only curative treatment for PNP deficiency is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here, we present a 13-yr-old girl with late-onset PNP deficiency. Despite many complications of infections, she was successfully transplanted with a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen from an HLA-identical unrelated donor.

Methodological and Clinical Aspects of Alloimmunization after Granulocyte Transfusion in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
>>-->>Publication Content>>
In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), granulocyte transfusions (GT) may be required in immunocompromised, neutropenic patients. In this context, alloimmunization against alloantigens may occur and affect HSCT outcome. Anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and -MHC class I chain related antigens A (MICA) antibody response after the administration of GT in 29 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT (n = 27) encompassing 109 sera was investigated by multianalyte microbead assay before and up to 6 month after HSCT. Anti-HLA class I and II antibodies emerged de novo in 11 (38%) and 4 (14%) patients, respectively. Similarly, preformed antibodies were observed in four cases (14%) for anti-HLA class I and also four patients for anti-HLA class II antibodies. Anti-MICA antibodies were observed in eight granulocyte recipients of which three patients developed anti-MICA antibodies after GT, whereas preformed antibodies were seen in five patients. The conversion to positivity for any of the investigated antibodies did not significantly affect overall survival or the incidence of GVHD. GT-associated alloantibody conversion observed did not significantly correlate with outcome. Thus, surveillance of anti-HLA antibodies in the course of GT in the context of HSCT may not be required routinely. The role of MICA antibodies in HSCT and GT, however, requires further study.

Reduced Il-35 Levels Are Associated with Increased Platelet Aggregation and Activation in Patients with Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major complication associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Interleukin (IL)-35 is a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine that suppresses the immune response. This prospective study explored IL-35 plasma levels in 65 patients after HSCT. The results revealed that the peripheral blood of patients with grades III-IV aGVHD (23.46 ng/ml) had reduced IL-35 compared to transplanted patients with grades I-II aGVHD (40.26 ng/ml, p < 0.01) or patients without aGVHD (41.40 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Allografts, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) and G-CSF-primed bone marrow (GBM), from 38 patients were analyzed for IL-35 levels with respect to aGVHD. The patients who received lower levels of IL-35 cells in the GBM (28.0 ng/ml, p = 0.551) or lower levels of IL-35 in PBPC (53.46 ng/ml, p = 0.03) exhibited a higher incidence of aGVHD. Patients with aGVHD have increased platelet aggregation. IL-35 was added to patient blood in vitro, and platelet aggregation was inhibited by IL-35 in a dose-dependent manner. The markers of platelet activation (CD62P/PAC-1) can also be inhibited by IL-35. The results indicate that IL-35 may affect the development of aGVHD by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. Our data suggests that IL-35 represents a potentially effective therapeutic agent against aGVHD after allo-HSCT.

Bone Marrow Engraftment and Associated Dermatologic Sequelae in a Three-Yr-Old after Liver Transplantation
>>-->>Publication Content>>
We present a case of a three-yr-old child with a history of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis treated with systemic chemotherapy, who developed progressive liver failure and received an orthotopic split liver transplant while continuing on chemotherapy. One month following transplant, he developed acute graft-vs.-host disease of the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Peripheral blood chimerism studies post-transplant demonstrated an increasing predominance of donor lymphocytes and granulocytes. Shortly after, the patient developed vitiligo, and two yr after transplantation, the patient developed skin manifestations of psoriasis. We discuss and review the current literature, which demonstrates that chimerism following liver transplantation is rare and in our patient may be related to his profound immunosuppression around the time of liver transplant as well the development of acute graft-versus-host disease. While autoimmune disease can occur after solid organ and stem cell transplant, our patient developed skin manifestations of autoimmunity after liver transplantation, which is also rarely described.

Rapid Generation of Clinical-Grade Antiviral T Cells: Selection of Suitable T-Cell Donors and Gmp-Compliant Manufacturing of Antiviral T Cells
>>-->>Publication Content>>
BackgroundThe adoptive transfer of allogeneic antiviral T lymphocytes derived from seropositive donors can safely and effectively reduce or prevent the clinical manifestation of viral infections or reactivations in immunocompromised recipients after hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT). Allogeneic third party T-cell donors offer an alternative option for patients receiving an allogeneic cord blood transplant or a transplant from a virus-seronegative donor and since donor blood is generally not available for solid organ recipients. Therefore we established a registry of potential third-party T-cell donors (allogeneic cell registry, alloCELL) providing detailed data on the assessment of a specific individual memory T-cell repertoire in response to antigens of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (ADV), and human herpesvirus (HHV) 6.MethodsTo obtain a manufacturing license according to the German Medicinal Products Act, the enrichment of clinical-grade CMV-specific T cells from three healthy CMV-seropositive donors was performed aseptically under GMP conditions using the CliniMACS cytokine capture system (CCS) after restimulation with an overlapping peptide pool of the immunodominant CMVpp65 antigen. Potential T-cell donors were selected from alloCELL and defined as eligible for clinical-grade antiviral T-cell generation if the peripheral fraction of IFN- inverted question mark+ T cells exceeded 0.03% of CD3+ lymphocytes as determined by IFN- inverted question mark cytokine secretion assay.ResultsStarting with low concentration of IFN- inverted question mark+ T cells (0.07-1.11%) we achieved 81.2%, 19.2%, and 63.1% IFN- inverted question mark+CD3+ T cells (1.42x106, 0.05x106, and 1.15x106) after enrichment. Using the CMVpp65 peptide pool for restimulation resulted in the activation of more CMV-specific CD8+ than CD4+ memory T cells, both of which were effectively enriched to a total of 81.0% CD8+IFN- inverted question mark+ and 38.4% CD4+IFN- inverted question mark+ T cells. In addition to T cells and NKT cells, all preparations contained acceptably low percentages of contaminating B cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and NK cells. The enriched T-cell products were stable over 72 h with respect to viability and ratio of T lymphocytes.ConclusionsThe generation of antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by CliniMACS CCS can be extended to a broad spectrum of common pathogen-derived peptide pools in single or multiple applications to facilitate and enhance the efficacy of adoptive T-cell immunotherapy.

Stem Cell Autograft and Allograft in Autoimmune Diseases
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an insufficiency of immune tolerance and, although treated with a number of useful drugs, may need more unconventional therapeutic strategies for their more severe presentations. Among such unconventional therapeutic approaches, stem cell autograft and allograft have been used, with the aim of stimulating disease remission by modifying the pathogenic mechanisms that induce anomalous responses against self-antigens. Autologous transplantation is performed with the purpose of retuning autoimmune cells, whereas allogeneic transplantation is performed with the purpose of replacing anomalous immune effectors and mediators. In this article, we comprehensively review up-to-date information on the autoimmune diseases for which the transplantation of stem cells is indicated.

Primary Immunodeficiencies: a Decade of Shifting Paradigms, the Current Status and the Emergence of Cutting-Edge Therapies and Diagnostics
>>-->>Publication Content>>
A shift has occurred in the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities considered for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Early diagnosis remains the mainstay in appropriate management and remarkably influences the prognosis. More specific diagnostic tests as well as therapeutic modalities have been introduced in the last few decades. Nonetheless, the importance of a thorough history taking and physical examination should not be neglected. Novel diagnostic modalities including genetic sequencing have led to the recognition of previously unknown defects underlying PIDs. In addition, newborn screening is being advocated as an imperative diagnostic test. In terms of treatment, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered the optimal treatment modality for many cases and has dramatically improved the outcome. Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells prior to transplantation has improved the efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this article, the latest advances made in terms of diagnosis and treatment of PIDs are reviewed.

Replication of Influenza Virus a in Swine Umbilical Cord Epithelial Stem-Like Cells
>>-->>Publication Content>>
ABSTRACT In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of epithelial stem-like cells from the swine umbilical cord and their susceptibility to influenza virus infection. Swine umbilical cord epithelial stem cells (SUCECs) expressed stem cell and pluripotency associated markers such as SSEA-1, SSEA-4, TRA 1-60 and TRA 1-81 and Oct4. Morphologically, cells displayed polygonal morphology and were found to express epithelial markers; pancytokeratin, cytokeratin-18 and occludin; mesenchymal cell markers CD44, CD90 and hematopoietic cell marker CD45 were not detected on these cells. The cells had extensive proliferation and self- renewal properties. The cells also possessed immunomodulatory activity and inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Also, higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were detected in SUCEC-T cell co-cultures. The cells were multipotent and differentiated into lung epithelial cells when cultured in epithelial differentiation media. We also examined if SUCECs are susceptible to infection with influenza virus. SUCECs expressed sialic acid receptors, used by influenza virus for binding to cells. The 2009 pandemic influenza virus and swine influenza virus replicated in these cells. SUCECs due to their differentiation and immunoregulatory properties will be useful as cellular therapy in a pig model for human diseases. Additionally, our data indicate that influenza virus can infect SUCECs and may transmit influenza virus from mother to fetus through umbilical cord and transplantation of influenza virus-infected stem cells may transmit infection to recipients. Therefore, we propose that umbilical cord cells, in addition to other agents, should also be tested for influenza virus before cryopreservation for future use as a cell therapy for disease conditions.

The Evaluation of Thioridazine as a Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Mobilizing Agent in Healthy Human Subjects
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Adhesion molecules comprise a large class of proteins that control the trafficking of hematopoietic progenitor cells between the bone marrow compartment and peripheral blood. The normal trafficking of blood-forming cells is dependent upon the controlled regulation of CXCR4, LFA-1 and VLA-4-mediated binding and unbinding events involving stromal elements.1, 2 The mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells has been exploited for numerous medical conditions, including the use of erythropoietin for the harvest of autologous red cells transfusions, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the release of granulocytes to treat chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and plerixafor for the mobilization of CD34 + HPCs cells in autologous stem cell transplantation.3.

Improved Hematopoietic Differentiation Efficiency of Gene-Corrected Beta-Thalassemia Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells by Crispr/Cas9 System
>>-->>Publication Content>>
The generation of beta-thalassemia (beta-Thal) patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), subsequent homologous recombination-based gene correction of disease-causing mutations/deletions in the beta-globin gene (HBB) and their derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation offers an ideal therapeutic solution for treating this disease. However, the hematopoietic differentiation efficiency of gene-corrected beta-Thal iPSCs has not been well evaluated in the previous studies. In this study, we used the latest gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to correct beta-Thal iPSCs, gene-corrected cells exhibit normal karyotypes and fully pluripotency as hES, showed no off-targeting effects. Then we evaluated the differentiation efficiency of the gene corrected beta-Thal iPSCs. We found that during hematopoietic differentiation, gene-corrected beta-Thal iPSCs showed increased embryoid body (EB) ratio and various hematopoietic progenitor cells percentages. More importantly, the gene-corrected beta-Thal iPS cell lines restored HBB expression and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared to un-corrected group. Our study suggested that hematopoietic differentiation efficiency of beta-Thal iPSCs were greatly improved once corrected by CRISPR/Cas9 system. And the information gained from our study would greatly promote the clinical application of beta-Thal iPSCs-derived HSCs in transplantation.

Trends in Incidence, Treatment and Survival of Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma, in the Netherlands, 1989-2010
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Only a small number of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma participates in clinical trials, particularly elderly patients are underrepresented. Therefore, we studied data of the population-based nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry to determine trends in incidence, treatment and survival in an unselected patient population. We included all patients aged 15 years and older with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma in the period 1989-2010 and mantle cell lymphoma in 2001-2010, with follow-up until February 2013. We examined incidence, first-line treatment and survival. We calculated annual percentage of change in incidence and carried out relative survival analyses. Incidence remained stable for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=23,527), while for mantle cell lymphoma (n=1,634) and Burkitt lymphoma (n=724) it increased for men and remained stable for women. No rise in survival for patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma was observed during 1989-1993 and 1994-1998 (5-year relative survival 42% [95%CI 39-45%] and 41% [38-44%], respectively), but increased to 46% (43-48%) in 1999-2004 and to 58% (56-61%) in 2005-2010. The rise in survival was most prominent in patients <65 years, while in patients >75 years this was smaller. However, when untreated patients were excluded, in patients >75 years the rise in survival was similar to younger patients. In the Netherlands, survival for patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma increased over time, particularly in younger patients, but also in elderly patients when treatment had been initiated. The improvement in survival coincided with the introduction of rituximab therapy and stem cell transplantation into clinical practice.

Are Stem Cells a Potential Therapeutic Tool in Coeliac Disease?
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Despite the growing understanding of its pathogenesis, the treatment of coeliac disease is still based on a lifelong gluten-free diet that, although efficacious, is troublesome for affected patients, and a definitive cure is still an unmet need. In this regard, the development of new chemical- and biological-derived agents has often resulted in unsatisfactory effects when tested in vivo, probably because of their ability to target only a single pathway, whilst the immunological cascade responsible for tissue injury is complex and redundant. The advent of cellular therapies, mainly based on the use of stem cells, is an emerging area of interest since it has the advantage of a multi-target strategy. Both haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells have been employed in the treatment of refractory patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, with promising results. However, the lack of immunogenicity makes mesenchymal stem cells more suitable than their haematopoietic counterpart, since their transplantation may be performed in the absence of a myeloablative conditioning regimen. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to harbour strong modulatory effects on almost all cells involved in immune response, together with a potent regenerative action. It is therefore conceivable that over the next few years their therapeutic use will increase as their biological interactions with injured tissues become clearer.

Autologous Transplantation of Cd34 Bone Marrow Derived Mononuclear Cells in Management of Non-Reconstructable Critical Lower Limb Ischemia
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Patients with a decrease in limb perfusion with a potential threat to limb viability manifested by ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and/or gangrene are considered to have critical limb ischemia (CLI). Because of this generally poor outcome, there is a strong need for attempting any procedure to save the affected limb. The aim of this work is to evaluate the possibility to use stem cell therapy as a treatment option for patients with chronic critical lower limb ischemia with no distal run off. This study includes 20 patients with chronic critical lower limb ischemia with no distal run off who are unsuitable for vascular or endovascular option. These patients underwent stem cell therapy (SCT) by autologous transplantation of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells. 55 % of patients treated with SCT showed improvement of the rest pain after the first month, 60 % continued improvement of the rest pain after 6 months, 75 % after 1 year and 80 % after 2 years and continued without any deterioration till the third year. Limb salvage rate after STC was 80 % after the first year till the end of the second and third years. SCT can result in angiogenesis in patients with no-option CLI, providing a foundation for the application of this therapy to leg ischemia.

Advances in Umbilical Cord Blood Manipulation-from Niche to Bedside
>>-->>Publication Content>>
The use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as an alternative haematopoietic cell source in lieu of bone marrow for haematopoietic reconstitution is increasingly becoming a mainstay treatment for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases, as most individuals will have at least one available, suitably HLA-matched unit of blood. The principal limitation of UCB is the low and finite number of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) relative to the number found in a typical bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood allograft, which leads to prolonged engraftment times. In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, strategies that are often based on native processes occurring in the bone marrow microenvironment or 'niche' have been developed with the goal of accelerating UCB engraftment. In broad terms, the two main approaches have been either to expand UCB HSPC ex vivo before transplantation, or to modulate HSPC functionality to increase the efficiency of HSPC homing to the bone marrow niche after transplant both of which enhance the biological activities of the engrafted HSPC. Several early phase clinical trials of these approaches have reported promising results.

Langerin-Expressing Dendritic Cells in Human Tissues Are Related to Cd1C+ Dendritic Cells and Distinct from Langerhans Cells and Cd141High Xcr1+ Dendritic Cells
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Langerin is a C-type lectin expressed at high level by LCs of the epidermis. Langerin is also expressed by CD8+/CD103+ XCR1+ cross-presenting DCs of mice but is not found on the homologous human CD141high XCR1+ myeloid DC. Here, we show that langerin is expressed at a low level on DCs isolated from dermis, lung, liver, and lymphoid tissue and that langerin+ DCs are closely related to CD1c+ myeloid DCs. They are distinguishable from LCs by the level of expression of CD1a, EpCAM, CD11b, CD11c, CD13, and CD33 and are found in tissues and tissue-draining LNs devoid of LCs. They are unrelated to CD141high XCR1+ myeloid DCs, lacking the characteristic expression profile of cross-presenting DCs, conserved between mammalian species. Stem cell transplantation and DC deficiency models confirm that dermal langerin+ DCs have an independent homeostasis to LCs. Langerin is not expressed by freshly isolated CD1c+ blood DCs but is rapidly induced on CD1c+ DCs by serum or TGF-beta via an ALK-3-dependent pathway. These results show that langerin is expressed outside of the LC compartment of humans and highlight a species difference: langerin is expressed by the XCR1+ "DC1" population of mice but is restricted to the CD1c+ "DC2" population of humans (homologous to CD11b+ DCs in the mouse).

Efficacy and Safety of Echinocandins versus Triazoles for the Prophylaxis and Treatment of Fungal Infections: a Meta-Analysis of Rcts
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Echinocandins and triazoles were proven to be effective antifungal drugs against invasive fungal infections (IFI), which may cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety between echinocandins and triazoles for the prophylaxis and treatment of fungal infections. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to July 2014. The quality of trials was assessed with the Jadad scoring system. The primary outcomes of interest were treatment success, microbiological success, breakthrough infection, drug-related adverse events (AEs), withdrawals due to AEs, and all-cause mortality. Ten RCTs, involving 2,837 patients, were included, as follows: caspofungin versus fluconazole (n = 1), caspofungin versus itraconazole (n = 1), anidulafungin versus fluconazole (n = 1), micafungin versus fluconazole (n = 4), micafungin versus voriconazole (n = 2), and micafungin versus itraconazole (n = 1). Echinocandins and triazoles showed similar effects in terms of favorable treatment success rate [relative risk (RR) = 1.02, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.97-1.08], microbiological success rate (RR = 0.98, 95 % CI, 0.90-1.15), breakthrough infection (RR = 1.09; 95 % CI, 0.59-2.01), drug-related AEs (RR = 0.94; 95 % CI, 0.71-1.15), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.85; 95 % CI, 0.66-1.10) in the prophylaxis and treatment of fungal infections. Additionally, echinocandins were more effective than triazoles for prophylaxis in patients undergoing hematologic malignancies or those who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; RR = 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.15). Echinocandins significantly decreased the AE-related withdrawals rate compared with triazoles (RR = 0.47; 95 % CI, 0.33-0.67). This meta-analysis revealed that echinocandins are as effective and safe as triazoles for the prophylaxis and treatment of patients with fungal infections.

Affinity of Fviii-Specific Antibodies Reveals Major Differences between Neutralizing and Non-Neutralizing Antibodies
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Recently, we reported that distinct isotypes and IgG subclasses of FVIII-specific antibodies are found in different cohorts of patients with hemophilia A and in healthy individuals. Led by these findings, we further investigated the distinguishing properties among the different populations of FVIII-specific antibodies. We hypothesized that the affinity of antibodies would discriminate between the neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies found in different study cohorts. To test this idea, we established a competition-based ELISA technology to assess the apparent affinities for each isotype and IgG subclass of FVIII-specific antibodies without the need for antibody purification. We present a unique data set of apparent affinities of FVIII-specific antibodies found in healthy individuals, patients with congenital hemophilia A with and without FVIII inhibitors and patients with acquired hemophilia A. Our data indicate FVIII-specific antibodies found in patients with FVIII inhibitors have an up to 100-fold higher apparent affinity than that of antibodies found in patients without inhibitors and in healthy individuals. High-affinity FVIII-specific antibodies could be retrospectively detected in longitudinal samples of an individual patient with FVIII inhibitors as long as 543 days before the first positive Bethesda assay. This suggests that these antibodies might serve as potential biomarkers for evolving FVIII inhibitor responses.
