Safety and Feasibility for Pediatric Cardiac Regeneration Using Epicardial Delivery of Autologous Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Mononuclear Cells Established in a Porcine Model System
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) requiring surgical palliation mandate new treatment strategies to optimize long-term outcomes. Despite the mounting evidence of cardiac regeneration, there are no long-term safety studies of autologous cell-based transplantation in the pediatric setting. We aimed to establish a porcine pipeline to evaluate the feasibility and long-term safety of autologous umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MNCs) transplanted into the right ventricle (RV) of juvenile porcine hearts. Piglets were born by caesarean section to enable UCB collection. Upon meeting release criteria, 12 animals were randomized in a double-blinded fashion prior to surgical delivery of test article (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6). The UCB-MNC (3 x 106 cells per kilogram) or control (dimethyl sulfoxide, 10%) products were injected intramyocardially into the RV under direct visualization. The cohorts were monitored for 3 months after product delivery with assessments of cardiac performance, rhythm, and serial cardiac biochemical markers, followed by terminal necropsy. No mortalities were associated with intramyocardial delivery of UCB-MNCs or placebo. Two animals from the placebo group developed local skin infection after surgery that responded to antibiotic treatment. Electrophysiological assessments revealed no arrhythmias in either group throughout the 3-month study. Two animals in the cell-therapy group had transient, subclinical dysrhythmia in the perioperative period, likely because of an exaggerated response to anesthesia. Overall, this study demonstrated that autologous UCB-MNCs can be safely collected and surgically delivered in a pediatric setting. The safety profile establishes the foundation for cell-based therapy directed at the RV of juvenile hearts and aims to accelerate cell-based therapies toward clinical trials for CHD.

How Far Are We from the Clinical Use of Placental-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells?
>>-->>Publication Content>>
In recent years, multiple studies have investigated the biology and clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), trying to define their markers, and elucidate their effects in animal models. MSCs are available from different tissues, and the use of placental-derived MSCs (PMSCs) for treating a variety of disorders is on the forefront. Herein, we discuss the most recent findings regarding the standardization of their isolation procedure and phenotype, along with advantages and limitations of their use. We also discuss the safety of the placental cell products, including the issue of senescence and mutagenesis of PMSCs, and efficacy from preclinical studies.

Optimal Method for Collection of Umbilical Cord Blood: an Egyptian Trial for a Public Cord Blood Bank
>>-->>Publication Content>>
BACKGROUND: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) contains stem cells and can be used as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. Engraftment is dependent on the total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ cell counts of the cord blood units. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of the method of collection of the UCB on the yield of the cord blood units. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Informed consent was obtained from 100 eligible mothers for donation of cord blood. Both in utero and ex utero methods were used for collection. The cord blood volume was measured. The TNC and the CD34+ cell counts were enumerated. RESULTS: We have found that in utero collection gave significantly larger volumes of cord blood and higher TNC counts than ex utero collection. There was no significant difference between both methods regarding the CD34+ cell counts. This study revealed a significant correlation between the volume of the collected cord blood and both TNC and CD34+ cell counts. CONCLUSION: It is better to collect cord blood in utero before placental delivery to optimize the quality of the cord blood unit.

Effects of Tobacco Smoking during Pregnancy on Oxidative Stress in the Umbilical Cord and Mononuclear Blood Cells of Neonates
>>-->>Publication Content>>
BackgroundAlthough cigarette smoke is known to be a complex mixture of over 4000 substances that can lead to damage through active or passive smoking, its mechanisms and biochemical consequences in pregnancy and neonates are not yet fully understood. Therefore, in the present study, we propose to study the impact of smoking during gestation on the viability of blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from umbilical cords of newborns to assess the degree of oxidative stress and cell viability. Moreover, we aim to investigate possible biochemical and morphological changes in the umbilical cord.MethodsAfter childbirth, the cord blood and the umbilical cord were immediately collected in public hospitals in Greater Vitoria, ES, Brazil. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cord blood and biochemical and histological tests were used to analyze the umbilical cord.ResultsPregnant smokers had a reduction of MNC viability from the umbilical cord (10%), an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase in cell apoptosis (~2-fold) compared to pregnant non-smokers. In the umbilical cord, it was observed an increase of advanced oxidation protein products - AOPP (~2.5-fold) and a loss of the typical architecture and disposition of endothelial cells from the umbilical artery.ConclusionsThese data suggest that maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy (even in small amounts) may compromise the viability of MNC cells and damage the umbilical cord structure, possibly by excessive ROS bioavailability.

The Runx1 +24 Enhancer and P1 Promoter Identify a Unique Subpopulation of Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells
>>-->>Publication Content>>
Derivation of hematopoietic stem cells from human pluripotent stem cells remains a key goal for the fields of developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Here, we use a novel genetic reporter system to prospectively identify and isolate early hematopoietic cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Cloning the human RUNX1c P1 promoter and +24 enhancer to drive expression of tdTomato (tdTom) in hESCs and iPSCs, we demonstrate that tdTom expression faithfully enriches for RUNX1c-expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated the tdTom+ hematopoietic cells to emerge from adherent cells. Furthermore, inhibition of primitive hematopoiesis by blocking Activin/Nodal signaling promoted the expansion and/or survival of tdTom+ population. Notably, RUNX1c/tdTom+ cells represent only a limited subpopuation of CD34+ CD45+ and CD34+ CD43+ cells with a unique genetic signature. Using gene array analysis, we find significantly lower expression of Let-7 and mir181a microRNAs in the RUNX1c/tdTom+ cell population. These phenotypic and genetic analyses comparing the RUNX1c/tdTom+ population to CD34+ CD45+ umbilical cord blood and fetal liver demonstrate several key differences that likely impact the development of HSCs capable of long-term multilineage engraftment from hESCs and iPSCs.

Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a Novel Platform for Simultaneous Evaluation of Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity of Pharmaceuticals
>>-->>Publication Content>>
The in vitro micronucleus test is a well-known test for the screening of genotoxic compounds. However until now, most studies have been performed on either human peripheral lymphocytes or established cancer cell lines. This study provides human mesenchymal stem cells as an alternative to the conventional micronucleus test. We grew umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) on coverslips eliminating the cumbersome technique involving hypotonic treatment, fixation and preparing smears required for suspension culture (lymphocytes). The background frequency of nuclear blebs and micronuclei in UC-MSCs was found to be 7+/-5, in lymphocytes 16+/-3.5 and 9+/-3 and that for A549 cell line was 65+/-5 and 15+/-5 per 1000 cells, respectively, suggesting differences in the repair mechanism of normal and cancer cell lines. We inspected the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of two known mutagens, mitomycin-C and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), on UC-MSCs, lymphocytes and A549 cells. Treatment with mitomycin-C and H2O2 demonstrated drastic differences in the degree of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity suggesting a constitutional difference between normal and cancer cells. In addition we tested two solvents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethanol, and two drugs, metformin and rapamycin. DMSO above 1% was found to be cytotoxic and genotoxic, whereas ethanol at same concentration was neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic indicating the minimal non-toxic level of the solvents. This study thus offers UC-MSCs as a better substitute to peripheral lymphocytes and cancer cell lines for high throughput screening of compounds and reducing the animal studies.

Extracardiac Control of Embryonic Cardiomyocyte Proliferation and Ventricular Wall Expansion
>>-->>Publication Content>>
AIMS: The strategies that control formation of the ventricular wall during heart development are not well understood. In previous studies, we documented IGF2 as a major mitogenic signal that controls ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation and chamber wall expansion. Our objective in this study was to define the tissue source of IGF2 in heart development and the upstream pathways that control its expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a number of mouse genetic tools, we confirm that the critical source of IGF2 is the epicardium. We find that epicardial Igf2 expression is controlled in a biphasic manner, first induced by erythropoietin, and then regulated by oxygen and glucose with onset of placental function. Both processes are independently controlled by retinoic acid signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that ventricular wall cardiomyocyte proliferation is subdivided into distinct regulatory phases. Each involves instructive cues that originate outside the heart and thereby act on the epicardium in an endocrine manner, a mode of regulation that is mostly unknown in embryogenesis.
